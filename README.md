# 4.3 PowerWriter Open API

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **PWLINK2 (including Lite), PW400** Please note that the functions described on the current page are not supported.
>
> **PWX1** UART port AT is not supported.

## 1.1 Overview 

AT Command Port, which supports control of input and output from both ends of the PowerWriter, i.e., the USB port and the extended general-purpose RX/TX port for input and output commands.

- USB-CDC: Users can send data to the PowerWriter via USB-CDC, and can also control the behaviour of the PowerWriter via AT commands supported by the PowerWriter to read status or data. This mode is suitable for users who want to develop secondary desktop software to integrate the PowerWriter to control the production process.
- Hardware UART (output serial port): In addition to using USB -CDC to control the behavior of the PowerWriter, users can also integrate the PowerWriter into a hardware control system to control the behavior of the PowerWriter, data uploads and downloads, which is suitable for the development mode away from the desktop system.

## 1.2 AT command enable

To use the AT function, you need to enable AT mode on the device first, refer to [4.1.2.4 Setting (S) | PowerWriter Docs](https://docs.powerwriter.com/en/docs/next/powerwriter_for_arm/reference/powerwriter/menu/setting/)

## 1.3 AT Command Structure

The standard AT command starts with "AT" and ends with a carriage return CR (LF), and the response style returned is 

```c
<\r\n><\r\n><body><\r\n><\r\n>
```

which is a purely string-based terminal response mode. On PowerWriter, due to the need for some interfaces to send large amounts of data, as well as the need for data encryption and better real-time performance, and to reduce the communications bandwidth consumption, the overall trade-offs, PowerWriter open AT interface using a unified binary format in order to provide better performance, the command structure is shown below:

| frame header |  length  |  data  | crc32 |
| :----------: | :------: | :----: | :---: |
|    "PWAT"    | uint32_t | object | crc32 |

- frame header : Sync header signal for PowerWriter to fetch AT commands from the stream, four bytes, no '\0' endings.
- length: length of the command frame, including: frameheader, length, data, crc32.
- data: object type, it is the command entity data, related to the corresponding command, please refer to AT command details and code.

  The format of data is defined as follows

  ```c
  typedef struct S_ATCmdObject{
      E_ATcmdType                 m_cmdType;          //Type                              
      uint32_t                    m_cmdSize;          //Size
      U_ATCmdProprety *           m_cmdPropretyp;     //Payload
  }S_ATCmdObject;
  ```

  m_cmdType: Indicates the command type, please refer to the definition of E_ATcmdType.

  m_cmdSize: indicates the effective data length of the current command (reserved)

  U_ATCmdProprety  : indicates the property node of the current command, each command has its own property node, please refer to the definition of U_ATCmdProprety.
- crc32: whole frame checksum value of command frame (frameheader, length, data),parameter configuration:

  > Polynomial        : 0x04C11DB7
  >
  > Initial/Final remainder : 0xffffffff
  >
  > Input/Output reverse   : yes
  >

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The interface data can be encrypted with AES128CBC encryption, and the communication password must be set manually on the PowerWriter.
> - Pure command line AT interface, please submit feedback.
> - data nodes are forced to be byte-aligned by default when they are defined. The purpose of doing so is to remove differences in compiler features (structure padding) across platforms, which can result in some performance loss, and in order to make up for the possible performance loss (memory copying), an attempt is made to align attribute nodes to 4 bytes by default when they are defined (32-bit platforms), which makes no difference in practice, but cannot be relied upon as a default feature of the compiler. .
> - The data node is not uniform in length, so if encryption is turned on, it will check if the total size of the object is aligned to 16 bytes, and if it is not, it will perform Zero padding at the end (some open source AES128CBC libraries come with other internal methods such as PKCS15, and not relying on the discretization feature is a good choice), so m_ cmdSize may actually be less than the length of the data node, up to 15 bytes.

```

#### 1.4.1.4 Updating Configuration{#ATCmdSetWriterCfg}

ATCmdSetWriterCfg

**Invoke Parameter**：S_ATCmdSetWriterCfg, same as [ATCmdRspWriterCfg](#ATCmdRspWriterCfg)

**Return Value**

[ATCmdStatusOK](#ATCmdStatusOK)、[ATCmdStatusError](#ATCmdStatusError)。

:::tip 

- For security reasons, some PowerWriter configurations are not allowed to be changed (modification is invalid), such as: **m_targetName, m_limitOfNumberEnable, m_limitOfNumber**.
- Programmer configuration information, by default PowerWrietr loads the offline project information at startup, if no offline project is preloaded, the default value is returned.

:::

#### 1.4.1.4 Setting the AT BaudRate{#ATCmdSetBaudrate}

ATCmdSetBaudrate

**Invoke Parameter**：S_ATCmdSetBaudrate

```c
typedef struct S_ATCmdObject
{
    union powerwriter_at_type
    {
        uint32_t m_baudrate;    // Set UART AT new baudrate;
    }property;
}S_ATCmdSetBaudrate;
```

m_baudrate: set new baud rate

**Return Value**

[ATCmdStatusOK](#ATCmdStatusOK)、[ATCmdStatusError](#ATCmdStatusError)。

:::caution 

- The USB port does not need to change the baud rate, it is a CDC interface and supports all baud rates, which are set automatically, and the UART port AT is a hardware UART port with a default baud rate of 9600.
- After receiving the command, the PowerWriter returns the response according to the baud rate before the setting, if the setting is successful, the PowerWriter will automatically enter the new baud rate communication, if it fails, it still keeps the old baud rate setting.

:::

### 1.4.2 Online operating {#OnlineAPI}

:::tip 

For online operation commands, you need to load the offline project first and perform data presetting before it is supported.

:::

#### 1.4.2.1 Connecting target chip{#ATCmdConnectTarget}

ATCmdConnectTarget

**Invoke Parameter**：S_ATCmdObject

**Return Value**

[ATCmdStatusOK](#ATCmdStatusOK)、[ATCmdStatusError](#ATCmdStatusError)。

#### 1.4.2.2 Get connection status{#ATCmdGetTargetStatus}

ATCmdGetTargetStatus

**Invoke Parameter**：S_ATCmdObject

**Return Value**

[ATCmdStatusOK](#ATCmdStatusOK)、[ATCmdStatusError](#ATCmdStatusError)。

#### 1.4.2.3 Get target chip ID{#ATCmdGetTargetChipID}

**Invoke Parameter**：S_ATCmdObject

**Return Value**

[ATCmdRspTargetChipID](#ATCmdRspTargetChipID)、[ATCmdStatusError](#ATCmdStatusError)。

#### 1.4.2.4 Returns target chip ID{#ATCmdRspTargetChipID}

ATCmdRspTargetChipID

**Invoke Parameter**：[ATCmdGetTargetChipID](#ATCmdGetTargetChipID)

**Return Value**

```c
    typedef struct S_ATCmdRspTargetChipID
    {
        uint8_t m_CIDSize;                   // Target chip ID size
        uint8_t m_CIDData[PW_TARGET_ID_MAX]; // Target chip ID data
    } S_ATCmdRspTargetChipID;
```

m_CIDSize: Current chip ID length

m_CIDData: The ID Data Buffer of the current chip, the reserved buffer length is PW_TARGET_ID_MAX(16).

:::tip 

Some chips have non-contiguous IDs, PowerWriter will give the non-contiguous chips in a continuous mode to remove redundant information.

:::

#### 1.4.2.5 Read target chip data{#ATCmdReadTargetMemory}

ATCmdReadTargetMemory

**Invoke Parameter**：S_ATCmdReadTargetMemory

```c
    typedef struct S_ATCmdReadTargetMemory{
        uint32_t   m_address;           //Target chip address, support such as SRAM、Flash、EEPROM、OTP etc...
        uint32_t   m_size;              //Data size of a single read (Must be less than 256)
    }S_ATCmdReadTargetMemory;
```

m_address: address for reading data, support SRAM, peripheral register value (some modules may need special permission, please feedback with us), Flash, EEPROM, OTP, etc.

m_size: the size of the read data.

:::tip 

The size of a single read should not exceed PW_BUFFER_MAX(256), otherwise PowerWriter will only return the length of PW_BUFFER_MAX. PowerWriter does not provide a continuous read command yet, although the continuous can improve the read/write efficiency, but it needs a large storage space to receive the data, which is not friendly to the AT interface of UART. This is not friendly to the AT interface on the UART side. If you have any special needs, please give us feedback, and there is no interface for mem8, mem16, mem32.

:::

**Return Value**：Refer to [ATCmdRspTargetMemory](#ATCmdRspTargetMemory)、[ATCmdStatusError](#ATCmdStatusError).

#### 1.4.2.6 Return data{#ATCmdRspTargetMemory}

ATCmdRspTargetMemory

**Invoke Parameter**：[ATCmdReadTargetMemory](#ATCmdReadTargetMemory)

**Return Value**S_ATCmdReadTargetMemory

```c

        uint32_t   m_size;                  //Current data size
        uint8_t    m_buffer[PW_BUFFER_MAX]; //Current data buffer (fixed length)
    }S_ATCmdRspTargetMemory;
```

m_address: Starting address of the actual returned data.

m_buffer：Data buffer (Note: buffer is fixed length).

#### 1.4.2.7 Erase Target Chip{#ATCmdEraseTarget}

ATCmdEraseTarget

**Invoke Parameter**：[S_ATCmdObject](#S_ATCmdObject)

**Return Value**[ATCmdStatusOK](#ATCmdStatusOK)、[ATCmdStatusError](#ATCmdStatusError)。

:::tip 

The time to erase the target chip is uncertain, and you need to reserve enough waiting time when executing this command.

:::

#### 1.4.2.8 Erase Sector{#ATCmdEraseTargetSectors}

ATCmdEraseTargetSectors

**Invoke Parameter**：ATCmdEraseTargetSectors

```c
    // Erase target chip
    typedef struct S_ATCmdReadTargetMemory{
        uint32_t   m_address;           //Target chip address, support such as SRAM、Flash、EEPROM、OTP etc...
        uint32_t   m_size;              //Data size of a single read (Must be less than 256)
    }S_ATCmdReadTargetMemory,
    S_ATCmdEraseTargetSectors;
```

m_address: Erase the address of the target chip (you can erase Flash, EEPROM, and other memory with a sector table).

m_size：Erase Length

**Return Value**[ATCmdStatusOK](#ATCmdStatusOK)、[ATCmdStatusError](#ATCmdStatusError)。

:::caution

Erasing addresses aligned to the sector start address, erasing an integer number of sectors is the optimal solution, if the start or end address is not aligned, **more sectors will be erased at the start address (rounded down) and one more sector at the end (rounded up). **

The time to erase the target chip is uncertain, and you need to reserve enough waiting time when executing this command.
